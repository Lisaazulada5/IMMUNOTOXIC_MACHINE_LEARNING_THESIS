Immunotoxicity Prediction Model
This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict immunotoxicity. This project is part of my Master's thesis in Toxicology and aims to leverage machine learning techniques to identify potential immunotoxic effects of chemical compounds, which is critical for ensuring the safety of pharmaceuticals and chemicals.

Project Overview
Immunotoxicity refers to the detrimental effects of substances on the immune system. Understanding these effects is crucial for the safe development of chemicals and drugs. This project focuses on using machine learning (ML) models to predict whether a compound is likely to cause immunotoxicity, using a dataset of chemical properties and toxicological data.

Key Objectives
Build and train a machine learning model for predicting immunotoxicity.
Evaluate various ML algorithms to determine the most effective for this prediction task.
Provide insights into the factors influencing immunotoxicity.
Technologies and Libraries Used
Python: The primary programming language used for data processing and model building.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computing.
Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: For documenting and running code interactively.
